		  <p class="illustration-caption">The four forces that determine whether a tool gets adopted, often invisible in usability testing.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="callout">
		  People don't adopt "features." They adopt a new way of working.
		</div>

		<div class="article-body">
		  <h2>Why "usable" isn't enough</h2>
		  <p>
			Most adoption failures aren't about whether the UI is clean. They're about whether the
			tool respects the constraints its users operate under: time, operational reality, risk
			tolerance, and social proof.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="fn-ref">1</a></sup>
		  </p>
		  <p>
			A tool can pass every usability test and still fail in the field. Usability testing
			measures whether someone <em>can</em> use a tool. Adoption depends on whether they
			<em>will</em>, repeatedly, under real conditions, when no one is watching. That
			distinction matters because lab conditions strip away exactly the forces that determine
			real-world use: time pressure, competing priorities, organizational politics, and the
			simple human preference for what's already familiar.
		  </p>

		  <h2>The four forces that decide adoption</h2>

		  <h3>1) Time</h3>
		  <p>
			If a new flow costs more minutes than it saves, it loses. Especially for high-throughput
			roles where every interaction is multiplied across hundreds of repetitions per day. The
			math is straightforward: a tool that saves 10 seconds per task but adds 30 seconds of
			learning friction is a net loss for months.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Time pressure also distorts evaluation. Under ideal conditions, people can see that a
			new tool is better. Under production conditions, they can only see that it's different.
			"Different" means slower. "Slower" means risk. And the person making that calculation
			is the one whose performance is being measured, not the person who chose the tool.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>Design implication:</strong> The fastest path should be the correct path. Efficiency
			isn't a nice-to-have; it's a prerequisite for adoption.
		  </p>

		  <h3>2) Trust</h3>
		  <p>
			Users don't trust outputs they can't explain. They also don't trust tools that fail
			silently. Confidence comes from visibility, guardrails, and predictable recovery. This
			is especially true for tools that automate decisions or recommend actions. If a user
			can't understand why the tool suggested something, they'll override it by default,
			regardless of whether the suggestion was correct.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Trust also builds unevenly. A single visible failure can undo weeks of correct behavior.
			The asymmetry is extreme: users remember the time the tool got it wrong far more than
			the hundred times it got it right. Designing for trust means designing for the moment
			things go wrong, not just the happy path.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>Design implication:</strong> Show your work. Make errors recoverable. Never hide
			what the system did.
		  </p>

		  <p class="pullquote">
			A single visible failure can undo weeks of correct behavior. Users remember
			the time the tool got it wrong far more than the hundred times it got it right.
		  </p>

		  <h3>3) Risk</h3>
		  <p>
			Adoption is constrained by consequences. If errors are expensive or embarrassing, users
			will prefer the old way, even if it's slower. The old way is <em>known</em>; the new
			way is a gamble.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="fn-ref">2</a></sup> This is rational behavior.
			Loss aversion isn't a bug in human cognition. It's a feature that protects people from
			downside scenarios that matter more than upside ones.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			In practice, this means that the perceived risk of a new tool matters more than its
			actual risk. If the tool looks unfamiliar, if the confirmation dialogs feel insufficient,
			if there's no clear undo, users will assume the worst and act accordingly. The tool
			doesn't need to be risky to fail. It just needs to feel risky.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>Design implication:</strong> Reduce the cost of trying. Make the first interaction
			low-stakes. Provide clear undo and confirmation for high-stakes actions.
		  </p>

		  <h3>4) Switching costs</h3>
		  <p>
			Every new tool competes with existing muscle memory, templates, spreadsheets, tribal
			knowledge, and "how we do it here." The new tool isn't competing with nothing; it's
			competing with everything users have already
			built.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="fn-ref">3</a></sup>
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Switching costs are often invisible to the people choosing the tool because they're
			not the ones paying the cost. The executive who approves the purchase doesn't have
			to rebuild their workflow. The manager who mandates adoption doesn't have to relearn
			keyboard shortcuts. The gap between who decides and who absorbs the friction is one
			of the most common reasons enterprise tools fail to stick.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>Design implication:</strong> Meet users where they are. Import existing data.
			Support existing terminology. Don't force a clean break.
		  </p>

		  <h2>Why pilots succeed and rollouts fail</h2>
		  <p>
			Pilots create artificial conditions: dedicated time, motivated participants, extra
			support, and a smaller audience that's often self-selected for enthusiasm. The real
			test is what happens when those conditions disappear. A tool that "worked in pilot"
			but fails at scale was never tested for adoption. It was tested for usability under
			favorable conditions, which is a very different thing.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The gap between pilot and production is the gap between ability and willingness. Pilots
			prove that people <em>can</em> use the tool. Rollout reveals whether they <em>will</em>.
			Designing for adoption means designing for the second question, not just the first.
		  </p>

		  <h2>A practical adoption design prompt</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li>What does success look like in <em>their</em> day, not ours?</li>
			<li>What's the smallest "try it once" path with a safe exit?</li>
			<li>Where is the tool asking for trust it hasn't earned?</li>
			<li>What must be true operationally for this to stick?</li>
			<li>What are users giving up to use this? Is that trade-off worth it to them?</li>
		  </ul>
