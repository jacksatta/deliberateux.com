		  <p class="illustration-caption">The four layers that determine whether a product gets adopted, regardless of how polished the interface is.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="callout">
		  When adoption fails, the UI gets blamed. But the system decides.
		</div>

		<div class="article-body">
		  <h2>The three layers UX can't out-design</h2>
		  <p>
			Designers often focus on the interaction layer: buttons, flows, visual hierarchy. That
			focus is appropriate and necessary. But adoption happens at deeper layers that the UI
			can't reach.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="fn-ref">1</a></sup> A beautifully designed tool
			will still fail if it's fighting the system it lives in.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			This is a difficult truth for design teams because the interaction layer is where they
			have the most control. Pixel-perfect screens, elegant transitions, thoughtful micro-copy.
			None of it matters if the organization around the product is optimizing for something else.
			The system has its own momentum, and that momentum doesn't care about your Figma file.
		  </p>

		  <h3>1) Incentives</h3>
		  <p>
			If leadership celebrates speed-to-launch, teams optimize for shipping, not learning. If
			sales promises "one-click magic," the product absorbs complexity until it breaks. The
			incentive structure determines what gets built, how it gets maintained, and whether
			anyone has time to fix what's broken.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="fn-ref">2</a></sup>
		  </p>
		  <p>
			This is not abstract. It shows up in specific, recurring patterns. The PM who can't
			justify a sprint on "making the existing thing less confusing" because the roadmap is
			measured in new features. The designer who flags a usability issue that never gets
			prioritized because it doesn't move a metric anyone is tracking. The engineer who knows
			the workaround but doesn't have time to fix the root cause.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>The symptom:</strong> Features ship fast but don't stick. Users complain, but roadmaps
			stay focused on "new" over "better."
		  </p>

		  <h3>2) Operations</h3>
		  <p>
			UX fails when the operational reality isn't designed for. Workarounds become the real
			interface. The tool assumes a clean workflow; the actual workflow involves three
			spreadsheets, a Slack channel, and tribal knowledge about which fields to
			skip.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="fn-ref">3</a></sup>
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Operational friction is especially insidious because it's invisible to anyone who
			isn't doing the work. Executives see dashboards. Product managers see feature lists.
			Designers see prototypes. But the person using the tool eight hours a day sees the gap
			between what the system assumes and what the day actually looks like. That gap is where
			adoption goes to die.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>The symptom:</strong> Users technically "use" the tool but route around it constantly.
			Time-on-task stays high. Training doesn't help.
		  </p>

		  <p class="pullquote">
			The person using the tool eight hours a day sees the gap between what the system
			assumes and what the day actually looks like. That gap is where adoption goes to die.
		  </p>

		  <h3>3) Time</h3>
		  <p>
			Time is the universal constraint. If your tool asks for time people don't have, they'll
			rationally decline, even if the tool is genuinely "better." A 30-second improvement per
			task sounds small until you multiply it by 200 tasks per day across 5,000 agents. That
			kind of math can justify significant investment, but only if you account for the learning
			curve on the other side.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The problem is that time savings are realized gradually, while time costs are paid
			immediately. A new tool has to be learned today. Its benefits arrive later, if at all.
			For someone under production pressure, that trade-off rarely makes sense. The rational
			choice is to stick with the familiar tool, even a worse one, because the familiar tool
			doesn't cost learning time.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>The symptom:</strong> Pilots succeed (participants have time to learn), but rollout fails
			(the broader population doesn't have time to change).
		  </p>

		  <h2>What this means for design practice</h2>
		  <p>
			Understanding these layers doesn't mean giving up on craft. It means expanding the definition
			of the problem. The question isn't just "Is this usable?" but "Is this adoptable given the
			system it lives in?"
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Practically, this means designers need to spend more time understanding the environment
			their product will live in. Who has authority to change workflows? What is the team
			actually measured on? How much slack exists in people's days? These questions feel like
			they belong to product management or operations, but they directly determine whether
			design work has any impact at all.
		  </p>

		  <h2>A diagnostic prompt</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li>What gets measured and rewarded in this organization?</li>
			<li>What does the actual workflow look like, not the documented one?</li>
			<li>How much time does the target user actually have?</li>
			<li>What would have to be true for this tool to stick?</li>
		  </ul>
