		<div class="article-body">
		  <h2>What "bad mapping" actually costs</h2>
		  <p>
			Stove knobs are the canonical example of poor mapping because the consequence is visible
			and immediate: you turn a knob, the wrong burner lights up. But the stove is just a stand-in
			for a much larger category of design failure. The same pattern shows up in admin consoles with
			settings that don't correspond to what they control, in forms where field order contradicts the
			user's mental model, and in agent tools where buttons trigger actions on objects that aren't
			visually related.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Norman described this gap as the "Gulf of Execution": the distance between what a user intends
			and what the interface makes possible to express.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="fn-ref">2</a></sup>
			The wider that gulf, the more cognitive work falls on the user. They have to maintain a
			translation layer in their head, converting between what they want and what the system expects.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The cost isn't just the occasional wrong burner. It's the overhead of translating on every
			interaction. Every time a user pauses to think "wait, which one is it?" the interface has
			failed, even if they ultimately get it right. That pause is invisible in analytics.
			It doesn't show up as an error. But it accumulates into fatigue, slowness, and quiet
			resentment toward tools that should be effortless.
		  </p>

		  <p class="pullquote">
			The worst mapping problems are the ones users have stopped noticing, because
			they've already absorbed the cost.
		  </p>

		  <h2>Why workarounds feel like competence</h2>
		  <p>
			People are remarkably good at adapting. They learn the quirks, build muscle memory, and teach
			each other. Over time, the workaround becomes invisible. It stops being a workaround and
			becomes "just how it works." The organization interprets this adaptation as evidence that the
			design is fine, even though the product is quietly training users to compensate for its failures.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			This creates a reinforcing cycle. Users who have invested effort in learning a broken model
			are often the loudest voices against fixing it. They've earned fluency through struggle, and
			changing the interface invalidates that investment. "Everyone knows how it works" becomes a
			reason not to make it work better.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Norman observed a related pattern: users tend to blame themselves rather than the design.
			When something goes wrong, people assume they did it incorrectly, not that the interface
			misled them.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="fn-ref">3</a></sup> This self-blame is a powerful
			shield for bad mapping. If users don't identify the design as the problem, they never
			request a fix. The interface survives not because it's good, but because its failures
			are attributed to human error rather than structural ambiguity.
		  </p>

		  <h2>Fixing mapping is a systems decision</h2>
		  <p>
			Mapping problems rarely persist because nobody sees them. They persist because the incentive
			structure doesn't reward fixing them. Shipping a new feature is visible. Rearranging controls
			so they correspond to what they actually do is not. The fix is often small in implementation
			but requires someone with authority to prioritize reduction over addition.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Good mapping isn't about labels or tooltips. Labels are a patch for broken spatial
			relationships. If you need a label to explain which control goes with which outcome, the
			layout itself has already failed. Norman's principle of natural mapping asks for something
			more fundamental: arrange controls so their position corresponds to the position of what
			they affect.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="fn-ref">4</a></sup> When you do that, the interface
			becomes self-explanatory. The need for labels, legends, and training materials drops away.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			This is why mapping is a systems decision, not a surface-level design task. It requires
			rethinking layout, information architecture, and sometimes hardware constraints. It means
			accepting that the current arrangement, however familiar, is costing more than it should.
		  </p>

		  <p class="pullquote">
			If you need a label to explain which control goes with which outcome, the layout has
			already failed.
		  </p>

		  <h2>The cost of "good enough"</h2>
		  <p>
			Every mapping problem is a small tax on attention. In low-stakes contexts, people pay that
			tax without complaint. You turn the wrong burner on at home, you notice, you switch it. The
			cost is a few seconds and minor annoyance.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			But the same structural problem in a high-stakes environment becomes dangerous. Medical
			device research has found that poor control-display mapping is a leading contributor to
			use-related adverse events.<sup><a href="#fn5" class="fn-ref">5</a></sup> In industrial
			controls, the wrong valve opened at the wrong time has caused equipment damage and safety
			incidents. In financial systems, mismatched control layouts have led to trades executed
			on the wrong account.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The pattern is the same in every case. The interface asks users to maintain a mental
			translation between what they see and what they mean. Under normal conditions, they
			manage. Under stress, fatigue, or time pressure, the translation breaks down. The
			question isn't whether mapping matters. It's whether you can afford to find out when
			it doesn't.
		  </p>

		  <h2>A practical checklist</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li>Can a first-time user predict the outcome before acting?</li>
			<li>Does the control layout match the real-world layout?</li>
			<li>Are labels redundant with the visual structure, or compensating for bad structure?</li>
			<li>Can mistakes be reversed safely?</li>
			<li>Is the "correct" action the easiest action?</li>
			<li>Would removing something make the mapping clearer?</li>
		  </ul>
