		  When controls don't map to outcomes, users invent a new interface: memory.

		<div class="article-body">
		  <h2>What "bad mapping" actually costs</h2>
		  <p>
			Stove knobs are the canonical example because the consequence is visible: the wrong burner turns on.
			But the pattern shows up everywhere: forms, admin consoles, agent tools, and "simple" settings screens.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The cost isn't just errors. It's the cognitive overhead of translating between what you see
			and what you want. Every time a user has to think "wait, which one is it?" the interface has
			failed, even if they get it right.
		  </p>

		  <h2>Why workarounds feel like competence</h2>
		  <p>
			People adapt. They learn the quirks, build muscle memory, and teach others. The system interprets this
			as "good enough," even though the product is quietly training users to compensate.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			This is why bad mapping persists: once users have learned to work around it, fixing it feels
			like disruption rather than improvement. "Everyone knows how it works" becomes a reason not
			to make it work better.
		  </p>

		  <h2>Fixing mapping is a systems decision</h2>
		  <p>
			Mapping problems persist when incentives reward shipping more screens instead of removing ambiguity.
			The fix is often small, but it requires someone to prioritize reduction over addition.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Good mapping isn't about labels or tooltips. It's about spatial correspondence: the control
			should be where you expect it, doing what you expect, with feedback that confirms.
		  </p>

		  <h2>The cost of "good enough"</h2>
		  <p>
			Every mapping problem is a small tax on attention. In low-stakes contexts, people pay it without
			noticing. In high-stakes contexts (medical devices, industrial controls, financial systems) the
			same pattern becomes dangerous.
		  </p>

		  <h2>A practical checklist</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li>Can a first-time user predict the outcome before acting?</li>
			<li>Does the control layout match the real-world layout?</li>
			<li>Are labels redundant with the visual structure (or compensating for bad structure)?</li>
			<li>Can mistakes be reversed safely?</li>
			<li>Is the "correct" action the easiest action?</li>
			<li>Would removing something make the mapping clearer?</li>
