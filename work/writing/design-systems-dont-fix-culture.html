		  The best design system is useless if teams aren't allowed to use it.
		</div>

		<div class="article-body">
		  <h2>The promise and the reality</h2>
		  <p>
			Design systems promise consistency, efficiency, and quality. They deliver components.
			The gap between promise and reality is filled by organizational culture: how decisions
			get made, who has authority, and what actually gets rewarded.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			A design system is infrastructure. Like any infrastructure, it only works if people
			choose to use it, and if the organization makes that choice
			easy.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="fn-ref">1</a></sup> A well-maintained highway is
			useless if the zoning laws send traffic somewhere else. A design system with beautiful
			components is useless if the sprint cycle doesn't leave time to learn them, or if the
			team building the feature has never heard of the system at all.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			This is why so many design system initiatives start with energy and end with
			abandonment. The system itself was never the constraint. The constraint was always
			the organization around it.
		  </p>

		  <h2>Why systems get bypassed</h2>
		  <p>
			Teams skip the design system when using it is harder than not using it. That calculus
			is made at the individual level, on every feature, in every sprint. It's not a
			one-time decision. It's an ongoing evaluation: is the system worth the overhead
			right now, in this context, under this deadline?
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The answer is often no. Not because the system is bad, but because the conditions
			don't support using it:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>The system doesn't have what they need, and contributing is too slow</li>
			<li>Deadlines reward shipping, not consistency</li>
			<li>Nobody enforces usage, so deviation has no consequence</li>
			<li>The system is owned by a team that doesn't understand their context</li>
			<li>Politics make collaboration with the system team uncomfortable<sup><a href="#fn2" class="fn-ref">2</a></sup></li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
			Each of these is a cultural problem wearing a systems costume. You can't fix them
			with better documentation or more components. They require changes in how the
			organization operates.
		  </p>

		  <p class="pullquote">
			Each of these is a cultural problem wearing a systems costume. You can't fix
			them with better documentation or more components.
		  </p>

		  <h2>Culture signals that predict system failure</h2>
		  <p>
			Watch for these patterns. They indicate that a design system will struggle, regardless
			of how good the components are:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>"That's not how we do things here" in response to system guidance</li>
			<li>No executive sponsor who cares about consistency</li>
			<li>Design and engineering operate as separate fiefdoms</li>
			<li>The system team is understaffed or treated as a cost center</li>
			<li>Teams are rewarded for speed, never for reuse</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
			These signals are often visible early. If you see them during the planning phase of a
			design system initiative, addressing them first will save months of work on components
			that nobody adopts. The difficult truth is that building the system is the easy part.
			Building the organizational conditions for the system to succeed is the hard part,
			and it's the part that rarely gets funded.
		  </p>

		  <h2>What actually helps</h2>
		  <p>
			The design system can't fix culture, but it can work with it. Systems that succeed
			tend to share certain traits:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>They make the right thing the easy thing</li>
			<li>They treat adoption as a product problem, not a compliance problem</li>
			<li>They have visible support from leadership</li>
			<li>They invest in contribution workflows, not just consumption</li>
			<li>They measure outcomes (consistency, velocity) not just coverage</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
			The common thread is that successful systems meet people where they are instead of
			demanding they change. They reduce friction rather than adding process. They make
			using the system feel like the path of least resistance, not an obligation.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			This is an uncomfortable inversion for design system teams. It means that the quality
			of your components matters less than the ease of adopting them. A mediocre component
			that's easy to use will beat a perfect component that's hard to find, slow to
			install, or poorly documented. The system team's job isn't to build the best
			components. It's to make using the system easier than not using it.
		  </p>

		  <h2>A diagnostic question</h2>
		  <p>
			Before investing more in the system itself, ask: if we made it perfect tomorrow,
			would teams actually use it? If the answer is uncertain, the problem isn't the
			system.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="fn-ref">3</a></sup> And no amount of component
			work will change that.
