		  <h2>The request always sounds reasonable</h2>
		  <p>
			"Can we add a field for X?" It seems small. One more input. A few more seconds. But
			fields compound. Each one asks for attention, demands a decision, and creates an
			opportunity for error or abandonment.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="fn-ref">1</a></sup>
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The request is always framed in terms of what the organization gets: more data, better
			segmentation, a new dimension for reporting. It is rarely framed in terms of what the
			user gives up: time, focus, and the willingness to complete the form at all. That
			framing gap is where field bloat begins.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The real question isn't "is this field useful?" The question is: useful to whom, and
			at whose expense?
		  </p>

		  <h2>Who pays for the field?</h2>
		  <p>
			Someone always pays for data collection. Usually it's the user, in the form of time,
			cognitive load, and decision fatigue. Sometimes it's the support team, handling confusion
			about what to enter. Often it's the data team, cleaning up inconsistent entries that
			nobody uses.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The distribution of cost matters because it's almost always unequal. The person
			requesting the field (typically a stakeholder, analyst, or product manager) rarely
			fills out the form themselves. They see the data after it's collected, stripped of the
			friction that produced it. From their perspective, the field is free. From the user's
			perspective, it's another tax on an already loaded workflow.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			That's why fields accumulate. The incentive to add is stronger than the incentive to
			remove.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="fn-ref">2</a></sup> Adding a field has a visible
			champion. Removing one rarely does.
		  </p>

		  <p class="pullquote">
			The person requesting the field rarely fills out the form themselves. They see
			the data after it's collected, stripped of the friction that produced it.
		  </p>

		  <h2>The compound effect</h2>
		  <p>
			One field: minor friction. Ten fields: noticeable burden. Twenty fields: users start
			gaming the system, entering garbage to get through, or abandoning entirely. The
			relationship between field count and completion is not linear. There's a threshold
			where users shift from "filling out the form" to "getting past the form," and the
			quality of every field degrades once that threshold is crossed.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			High-volume workflows feel this most acutely. If an agent fills out a form 200 times
			a day, every unnecessary field costs thousands of interactions per
			week.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="fn-ref">3</a></sup> At that scale, a single
			questionable field isn't a minor annoyance. It's an operational cost that ripples
			through the entire system: slower throughput, more data entry errors, higher
			frustration, and eventually, workarounds that bypass the form entirely.
		  </p>

		  <h2>When to push back</h2>
		  <p>
			Not every field request deserves resistance. Some fields are genuinely necessary.
			The goal isn't to say no reflexively but to apply consistent scrutiny:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Is this data actually used in a decision, or just "nice to have"?</li>
			<li>Could this be derived or defaulted instead of asked?</li>
			<li>What happens if we collect this later, or not at all?</li>
			<li>Who reviews this data, and how often?</li>
			<li>What's the abandonment rate for this form?</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
			If the answers to these questions are vague or uncertain, the field probably isn't
			justified. The burden of proof should fall on the person requesting the addition,
			not on the person defending the user's time.
		  </p>

		  <h2>The alternative to adding</h2>
		  <p>
			Before adding a field, try removing one. Audit what you already collect. Most
			organizations discover fields that nobody reads, reports that nobody runs, and
			requirements that outlived their purpose. A quarterly form audit is one of the
			highest-leverage UX activities a team can do, and it almost never happens.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The goal isn't minimal forms. It's appropriate forms. Every field should earn its
			place, and that place should be re-earned periodically. Data collection is easy to
			start and hard to stop. Building a habit of subtraction is the only reliable
			counterweight.
