		  <h2>The request always sounds reasonable</h2>
		  <p>
			"Can we add a field for X?" It seems small. One more input. A few more seconds.
			But fields compound. Each one asks for attention, demands a decision, and creates
			an opportunity for error or abandonment.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The real question isn't "is this field useful?" The question is: useful to whom,
			and at whose expense?
		  </p>

		  <h2>Who pays for the field?</h2>
		  <p>
			Someone always pays for data collection. Usually it's the user, in the form of
			time, cognitive load, and decision fatigue. Sometimes it's the support team,
			handling confusion about what to enter. Often it's the data team, cleaning up
			inconsistent entries that nobody uses.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The person requesting the field rarely bears the cost. That's why fields
			accumulate. The incentive to add is stronger than the incentive to remove.
		  </p>

		  <h2>The compound effect</h2>
		  <p>
			One field: minor friction. Ten fields: noticeable burden. Twenty fields: users
			start gaming the system, entering garbage to get through, or abandoning entirely.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			High-volume workflows feel this most acutely. If an agent fills out a form 200
			times a day, every unnecessary field costs thousands of interactions per week.
		  </p>

		  <h2>When to push back</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li>Is this data actually used, or just "nice to have"?</li>
			<li>Could this be derived or defaulted instead of asked?</li>
			<li>What happens if we collect this later, or not at all?</li>
			<li>Who reviews this data, and how often?</li>
			<li>What's the abandonment rate for this form?</li>
		  </ul>

		  <h2>The alternative to adding</h2>
		  <p>
			Before adding a field, try removing one. Audit what you already collect. Most
			organizations discover fields that nobody reads, reports that nobody runs,
			and requirements that outlived their purpose.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The goal isn't minimal forms. It's appropriate forms. Every field should
			earn its place.
