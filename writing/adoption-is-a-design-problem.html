		  <p class="illustration-caption">The four forces that determine whether a tool gets adopted, often invisible in usability testing.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="callout">
		  People don't adopt "features." They adopt a new way of working.
		</div>

		<div class="article-body">
		  <h2>Why "usable" isn't enough</h2>
		  <p>
			Most adoption failures aren't about whether the UI is clean. They're about whether the tool
			respects constraints: time, operational reality, risk tolerance, and social proof.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			A tool can pass every usability test and still fail in the field. Usability testing measures
			whether someone <em>can</em> use a tool. Adoption depends on whether they <em>will</em>, repeatedly,
			under real conditions, when no one's watching.
		  </p>

		  <h2>The four forces that decide adoption</h2>

		  <h3>1) Time</h3>
		  <p>
			If a new flow costs more minutes than it saves, it loses. Especially for high-throughput roles.
			The math is brutal: a tool that saves 10 seconds but adds 30 seconds of learning friction
			is a net loss for months.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>Design implication:</strong> The fastest path should be the correct path. Efficiency
			isn't a nice-to-have; it's a prerequisite for adoption.
		  </p>

		  <h3>2) Trust</h3>
		  <p>
			Users don't trust outputs they can't explain. They also don't trust tools that fail silently.
			Confidence comes from visibility, guardrails, and predictable recovery.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>Design implication:</strong> Show your work. Make errors recoverable. Never hide
			what the system did.
		  </p>

		  <h3>3) Risk</h3>
		  <p>
			Adoption is constrained by consequences. If errors are expensive or embarrassing, users will
			prefer the old way—even if it's slower. The old way is <em>known</em>; the new way is a gamble.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>Design implication:</strong> Reduce the cost of trying. Make the first interaction
			low-stakes. Provide clear undo and confirmation for high-stakes actions.
		  </p>

		  <h3>4) Switching costs</h3>
		  <p>
			Every new tool competes with existing muscle memory, templates, spreadsheets, tribal knowledge,
			and "how we do it here." The new tool isn't competing with nothing; it's competing with
			everything users have already built.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>Design implication:</strong> Meet users where they are. Import existing data.
			Support existing terminology. Don't force a clean break.
		  </p>

		  <h2>Why pilots succeed and rollouts fail</h2>
		  <p>
			Pilots create artificial conditions: dedicated time, motivated participants, extra support.
			The real test is what happens when those conditions disappear. A tool that "worked in pilot"
			but fails at scale was never tested for adoption—only for usability.
		  </p>

		  <h2>A practical adoption design prompt</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li>What does success look like in <em>their</em> day, not ours?</li>
			<li>What's the smallest "try it once" path with a safe exit?</li>
			<li>Where is the tool asking for trust it hasn't earned?</li>
			<li>What must be true operationally for this to stick?</li>
			<li>What are users giving up to use this? Is that trade-off worth it to them?</li>
		  </ul>
