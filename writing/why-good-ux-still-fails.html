		  <div class="illustration-layers">
			<div class="layer layer-ui">UI Layer</div>

			<div class="layer layer-incentives">Incentives</div>
			<div class="layer layer-time">Time</div>
		  </div>
		  <p class="illustration-caption">The four layers that determine whether a product gets adopted, regardless of how polished the interface is.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="callout">
		  When adoption fails, the UI gets blamed. But the system decides.
		</div>

		<div class="article-body">
		  <h2>The three layers UX can't out-design</h2>
		  <p>
			Designers often focus on the interaction layer: buttons, flows, visual hierarchy. But adoption
			happens at deeper layers that the UI can't reach. A beautifully designed tool will still fail
			if it's fighting the system it lives in.
		  </p>

		  <h3>1) Incentives</h3>
		  <p>
			If leadership celebrates speed-to-launch, teams optimize for shipping, not learning. If sales promises
			"one-click magic," the product absorbs complexity until it breaks. The incentive structure determines
			what gets built, how it gets maintained, and whether anyone has time to fix what's broken.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>The symptom:</strong> Features ship fast but don't stick. Users complain, but roadmaps
			stay focused on "new" over "better."
		  </p>

		  <h3>2) Operations</h3>
		  <p>
			UX fails when the operational reality isn't designed. Workarounds become the real interface.
			The tool assumes a clean workflow; the actual workflow involves three spreadsheets, a Slack channel,
			and tribal knowledge about which fields to skip.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>The symptom:</strong> Users technically "use" the tool but route around it constantly.
			Time-on-task stays high. Training doesn't help.
		  </p>

		  <h3>3) Time</h3>
		  <p>
			Time is the universal constraint. If your tool asks for time people don't have, they'll rationally decline,
			even if it's "better." A 30-second improvement per task sounds small until you multiply it by
			200 tasks per day across 5,000 agents.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong>The symptom:</strong> Pilots succeed (people have time to learn), but rollout fails
			(people don't have time to change).
		  </p>

		  <h2>What this means for design practice</h2>
		  <p>
			Understanding these layers doesn't mean giving up on craft. It means expanding the definition
			of the problem. The question isn't just "Is this usable?" but "Is this adoptable given the
			system it lives in?"
		  </p>

		  <h2>A diagnostic prompt</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li>What gets measured and rewarded in this organization?</li>
			<li>What does the actual workflow look like, not the documented one?</li>
			<li>How much time does the target user actually have?</li>
			<li>What would have to be true for this tool to stick?</li>
		  </ul>
