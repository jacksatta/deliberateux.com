		  The best design system is useless if teams aren't allowed to use it.
		</div>

		<div class="article-body">
		  <h2>The promise and the reality</h2>
		  <p>
			Design systems promise consistency, efficiency, and quality. They deliver
			components. The gap between promise and reality is filled by organizational
			culture: how decisions get made, who has authority, and what actually gets
			rewarded.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			A design system is infrastructure. Like any infrastructure, it only works
			if people choose to use it, and if the organization makes that choice easy.
		  </p>

		  <h2>Why systems get bypassed</h2>
		  <p>
			Teams skip the design system when using it is harder than not using it.
			This happens when:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>The system doesn't have what they need, and contributing is too slow</li>
			<li>Deadlines reward shipping, not consistency</li>
			<li>Nobody enforces usage, so deviation has no consequence</li>
			<li>The system is owned by a team that doesn't understand their context</li>
			<li>Politics make collaboration with the system team uncomfortable</li>
		  </ul>

		  <h2>Culture signals that predict system failure</h2>
		  <p>
			Watch for these patterns. They indicate that a design system will struggle,
			regardless of how good the components are:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>"That's not how we do things here" in response to system guidance</li>
			<li>No executive sponsor who cares about consistency</li>
			<li>Design and engineering operate as separate fiefdoms</li>
			<li>The system team is understaffed or treated as a cost center</li>
			<li>Teams are rewarded for speed, never for reuse</li>
		  </ul>

		  <h2>What actually helps</h2>
		  <p>
			The design system can't fix culture, but it can work with it. Systems that
			succeed tend to share certain traits:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>They make the right thing the easy thing</li>
			<li>They treat adoption as a product problem, not a compliance problem</li>
			<li>They have visible support from leadership</li>
			<li>They invest in contribution workflows, not just consumption</li>
			<li>They measure outcomes (consistency, velocity) not just coverage</li>
		  </ul>

		  <h2>A diagnostic question</h2>
		  <p>
			Before investing more in the system itself, ask: if we made it perfect
			tomorrow, would teams actually use it? If the answer is uncertain, the
			problem isn't the system.
